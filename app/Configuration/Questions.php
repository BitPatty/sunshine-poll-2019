           that a timing method should be allowed on the leaderboard, as well as specificites contained in that.
           Any and all timing methods that receive over 50% approval will be allowed on the leaderboard.
           These changes will apply to all categories that currently start from a new file (Any%, 120 Shines, etc.).
           <br>(Note: File Select will always be allowed on the board, regardless of the poll results.)
           <br><br>To be able to vote you need a <a href="https://speedrun.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">speedrun.com</a>
           account. Votes from people with runs on the Super Mario Sunshine main or category extension leaderboards are automatically verified,
           while all other votes will go through a process of manual verification.
           <br><br>The different timing methods will be seperated by variables on the leaderboard:
